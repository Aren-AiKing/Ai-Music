This project aims to explore the intersection of artificial intelligence (AI) and music. It focuses on using AI techniques to read and compute music, enabling automated music analysis, generation, and processing. Whether you're a musician looking to automate music transcription, a developer creating music-based applications, or a researcher studying AI in the music domain, this project provides the tools and resources to get started.
